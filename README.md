 Demostrating Strategic and Factory design Pattern
 •	I used the Strategic Pattern to change streams categories at a runtime, e.g. the user will be able to change from streaming Movies to Sports at run time.
 •	I used Factory pattern to create different subscriptions that we offer (Deluxe and Essential).
